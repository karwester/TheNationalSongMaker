Sit down dear we gotta talk
You're acting like a kid
We don't wanna hear about
The things you never did

You coulda been a legend
But you became a father
That's what you are today
That's what you are today

Spending all your time
Somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important
Life you coulda lead

But your kisses aren't enough
To keep your kids in line
So you better straighten out yourself
And give your baby time
Cause if you don't give her what she needs
She'll get it where she can
She's lonely man

Don't leave yourself alone for too many days
Sooner than you know your gonna start slipping

You'll end up talking to the ghost
Of your wife as if you knew her
Your eyes will put her everywhere

And spending all your time
Somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important
Life you coulda lead

You'll fuck yourself to clear your head
You'll close your door and go to bed
You'll try to sleep without a dream
That's where she finds you
That's where she finds you

Don't leave yourself alone for too many days
Sooner than you know your gonna start slipping

Dear we better get a drink in you
Before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you
Before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you
Before you start to bore us
