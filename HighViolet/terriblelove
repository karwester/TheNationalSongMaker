It's a terrible love
That I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
That I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes awhile
To settle down
My shivered bones
Until the panic's out

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
Company
It's quite a company
It's quiet company

But I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would
But then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love
And I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love
That I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
