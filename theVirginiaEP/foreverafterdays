On my feet I stand tonight
Stand and step up to the light
An extraordinary man
Unbroken in a breaking light

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
Hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

On my feet I stand tonight
Stand alone inside the air
An extraordinary man
Everything stops and holds me there

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made
