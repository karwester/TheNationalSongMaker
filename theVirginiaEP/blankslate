I fell off the chair and cracked open my head

Geese flew out and they flew up the stairs 'cause they wanted to travel the world
But I keep it upstairs

Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs

Gonna be a blank slate, gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs

Gonna jump out of a cake with my heart on a string
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs

I go out looking in parked cars
For somebody famous to kidnap and love
Beat off the army with a tennis racket
