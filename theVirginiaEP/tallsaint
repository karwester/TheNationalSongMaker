Keep your legs from shaking, fill your eyes with new tears,
Don't ask questions, you don't know your name,
Something for everyone, try to win prizes,
Stay young and quiet.

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me.

Don't tell everybody at the table about your dreams,
They're too amazing, it'll melt their minds,
Take 'em to Hollywood, cut out the good parts,
Become millionaires.

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I've been looking for you all night, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint.

In my city, I didn't make a sound,
When I fell over and cracked my crown,
Heard a woman say 
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint.

In my city, I didn't make a sound,
When I fell over and cracked my crown,
Heard a woman say 
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

But I got up, got in a car,
Said "I don't think I'm gonna go very far"
Just take me one time around the ballroom slow,
And take me home.
