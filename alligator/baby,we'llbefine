All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
"Son, I've been hearing good things"

I wake up without warning
And go flying around the house
In my savignon fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror

Say "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave and be kind"

I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

Baby, come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay

Just say something perfect, something I can steal
Say "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave and be kind"

I pull off your jeans and you spill jack and coke in my collar
I melt like a witch and scream

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
