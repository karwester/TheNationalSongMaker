I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks
Everywhere you go is swirling, everything you say has water under it
You know I keep your fingerprints in a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround, think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy

I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind every time I decide to let it go
I was up all night again, boning up and reading the American dictionary
You'll never believe me what I found, think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy
