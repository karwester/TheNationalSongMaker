It's so easy to set off
The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different

This one's like your sister's best friends in her bed calling me to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms when she was young and sunburnt in the '80s
Lasts forever

The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendship
And bad taste in liquids

This one's like the wilderness, without the world I'm gonna miss those longs nights, the windows open
I keep re-reading the same lines always up at 5am every morning
Like a baby

It's just the lights coming on
It's just the lights coming on

I have no positions
No point of view or vision
I'm just trying to stay in touch with anything I'm still in touch with

The sky's getting whiter
I can't find a liner anywhere I'm going crazy
I'm not crazy
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you, I'll still destroy you

It's just the lights coming on
It's just the lights coming on
