We've been stuck out here in the hallway for way way too long
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss, losing grip, the fabrics rip
Go back to sleep, let me drive, let me think, let me figure it out
How to get us back to the place where we were when we first went out

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

Losing parents, losing sense
I don't know what we should do
Became a father when I was still a son, she brings it out in you
See you at the end of the party with your wild, wide eyes
Filling up the teacup with gin and your secret postcard life

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

We'll leave our saviors wrapped around immense new machines
We're at the ends of threads that hold their bodies to the ground
And then a man who looks a little and liked and felt like me
Offered them some bottled water, then they cut them down
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different
Your voice was low, blended in, I could barely hear you speak
You were always my last second, last ride in the distance
Thought that we were something good
That I would always keep

I'll still destroy you some day, sleep well beast, you as well beast
I'll still destroy you some day, sleep well beast, you as well beast
I'll still destroy you some day, sleep well beast, you as well beast
I'll still destroy you some day, sleep well beast, you as well beast
