Give my jewels to the army, my silverware and jeans
Give my love to your family; tell them anything.
Give yourself to anyone; give yourself away
Don't be a nightingale for anyone's space to fill.
If I could, I'd be your star again
Fall across your falling sky...

It takes a lot of little rain to make you feel like nothing.
Anything, anything you can do, do to me for everything I did for you
Nothing.
I didn't try to take your love away
I just never knew I had it...

There is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
American
There is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
American.

American mary.

If you kiss me, kiss me with your silver eyes
Don't look at me like someone you don't recognize
I didn't try to do this.
Your arms around my shoulderblades
Are useless.

There is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
American
There is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
American.

American mary.
