Sweetie, you don't look so good
Your bottom lip is bleeding.
I cut it on your collarbone
Go on, go back to sleep.

Sugar, who were you thinking of?
You woke me with your breathing.
Honey, how am I supposed to tell?

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

Thought I saw you on the stairs
Of this american century.
I went up through all the years
You were years ahead of me.
Remember when you dipped your hand?
I never saw it coming.
You took the wind out of me.

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in the better life you led?

I'd do you better than you do
I'd do you better than you ever will
When I am on bitters and absolut.
