Ten years older than I was
What I brought you down to see,
What I thought would make you fall in love

Wearing off on our dreams
Someday man I'm gonna be no different than the other rivers
I tried to look at you but I couldnt break the ice
You stood out there for an hour freezing
Put your hand around my back
I guess you thought I needed that

I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
I hope you're not alone

Wanted me to take you home
You said you'd rather be alone
I never thought of that
Car is warm and we had wine
But I couldn't find the perfect song

Now our furniture for the one with crows feet and I can't even remember the call
Sometimes I can feel your weight when I close my eyes
Seven times I was under you

I never try to find you
I hope you dont remember me
I hope your not alone
I don't wanna know what your thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just fucking drinking

Shallow frame and shaky sticks but I know there's a river in me
Shallow minded adult tricks but I know there's a river in me
